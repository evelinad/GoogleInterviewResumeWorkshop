#Google Resume/Interview Workshop

**Steven Schmatz**, steven@schmatz.me. October 28th 2014.

##Technical Interview

What it actually *looks like*:

* 45 minutes 1:1 with a Google engineer, 1-3 technical questions
* Write code to implement your solutions
* Interviewers submit feedback, including your code, to hiring committee. Programming skills, comm skills, "Googliness"
* No input in hiring committee from recruiter

###Examples

The blender question is a *no*. lol

Suppose you have a gift certificate worth $N$ dollars and you have a set of items on amazon.com you are interested in. Write a program to find a pair that you can purchase from this set to exactly use your gift certificate.

* You have to wrote code on a whiteboard

####Coming up with a solution

Start by discussing the problem:

* Distill it to a programming task, including input/output (method signature) (this is a reason why using Python as an interviewing language might suck a teensy bit)

```c++
void foo(int bar);
```

* Ask about any assumptions you can make.
* Work through simple examples.
* Think of a solution **aloud**, but don't code yet! It's okay if imperfect – make it clear that you want to get something correct before you try to do better.
* State big-O complexity of your solution and ask if it's reasonable -- might lead to guidance to do better. (*Good way to get hints without actually asking for hints*)

Now you are ready to code!

####Coding

Write actual code in the language of your choice.
* Verbally describe your code as you write it.
* Can start with pseudocode but replace later.

Most important thing is to write correct code.
* It helps a **TON** to get it correct on the first try!
* Structure your code to avoid having to go back and forth.
* Don't be afraid to break code into separate methods, but be **SURE** your method takes the right parameters.

Step through your code with some simple test cases!

Manage your time.

*Get to the point where you can write code, more or less straight line, correct on the first try. This is why a whiteboard is helpful – if it's annoying to write code on a whiteboard, you're doing it wrong.*

*Don't turn the discussion into a fillibuster and not have any time to produce code at the end.*

Preparation is the number 1 thing.
* Over the course of your academic career... AND extra effort leading up to the interview!

**PRACTICE!!**

* Problems often involve things you learned in data structures and algorithms classes.
* Find data structures and algorithms homework problems, close the book, and write your code.
* Can also use Google to search "Google Interviews". *There are questions that they have asked. You're not allowed to use Bing though*.
* Start with your favorite IDE but switch to paper eventually.

####*Understand your toolkit. Your programming standard library.*

Java collections / STL (use, complexity, and implementation)
* Stack, Queue, TreeMap, HashMap ...

Implementation of data structures.
* Linked lists, trees, hash tables, graphs, heaps

*A lot of times, interview questions involve implementing data structures in a new way*

Key algorithms and techniques
* Sorting algorithms, binary search, recursion, threading

Google's own distributed systems ("think like a Googler")
* MapReduce, GFS, BigTable

###What your interviewer is thinking

* Can this person think on their feet?
* Can this person articulate their thought process?
* Does this person know how to write and test code?
* Do I want this person working on my team? *This is a really good question. "Do I think that they would make my team better?"*

##Resume

###Parts of resume

* Name and contact info
* Objective (maybe)
* Education FIRST (helps them understand what you've done, what you haven't done). Degree, school, GPA. Relevant coursework (course titles). 
* Project, dates, important details
* Skills, activities, honors (important)

###YES

* Trim it down
* Clean, concise, simple
* Focus on *impact*
* Graduation date

###NO
* Too much text
* Typos
* Inflated skills
* Programming experience: don't do a chart (tacky)
